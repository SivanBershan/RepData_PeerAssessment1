This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
activity = read.csv("~/Desktop/R/activity.csv")

#Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
stepsPDay = group_by(activity, date)
stepsPDay = summarize(stepsPDay, SumSteps = sum(steps))
hist(stepsPDay$SumSteps)

#Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
#MeanSteps 
mean(stepsPDay$SumSteps, na.rm = T)
#MedianSteps
median(stepsPDay$SumSteps, na.rm = T)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=T}
#What is the average daily activity pattern?
library(ggplot2)
#Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged #across all days (y-axis)
dailypattern = group_by(activity, interval)
dailypattern = summarize(dailypattern, MeanSteps = mean(steps, na.rm = T))
qplot(interval, MeanSteps, data = dailypattern, geom = "line")

#Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
which(dailypattern$MeanSteps == (max(dailypattern$MeanSteps)))



```


```{r, echo=T}
#Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
missingvalues = is.na(activity$steps)
sum(missingvalues)

#Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. #For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
#Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

fillinMissingValues = merge(activity, dailypattern)
fillinMissingValues$steps = ifelse(is.na(fillinMissingValues$steps), 
                                   fillinMissingValues$MeanSteps, fillinMissingValues$steps)
fillinMissingValues$MeanSteps = NULL
head(fillinMissingValues, 25)



#Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of #steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 

stepsPDay = group_by(fillinMissingValues, date)
stepsPDay = summarize(stepsPDay, SumSteps = sum(steps))
hist(stepsPDay$SumSteps)

#Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
#MeanSteps 
mean(stepsPDay$SumSteps, na.rm = T)
#MedianSteps
median(stepsPDay$SumSteps, na.rm = T)

```
Question: What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
Answer: The median has slightly increased by 1. 

```{r, echo=T}
#Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a #weekday or weekend day.

fillinMissingValues$Weekday = ifelse((weekdays(as.Date(as.character(fillinMissingValues$date))) == "Sunday" | (weekdays(as.Date(as.character(fillinMissingValues$date))) == "Saturday")), "weekend", "weekday")

head(fillinMissingValues, 25)

#Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number #of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). The plot should look something like the following#, which was creating using simulated data:

plotdata = group_by(fillinMissingValues, interval, Weekday)
plotdata = summarize(plotdata, MeanStepsPDay =  mean(steps))
qplot(interval, MeanStepsPDay, data = plotdata, geom = "line") + facet_wrap(~Weekday, ncol = 1)
```
